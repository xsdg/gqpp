[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application

# The Desktop file MUST contain the following:
Categories=Graphics;

# The name which appears in the menu:
Name=Template
#Name[cs]=Šablona
#Name[fr]=Modèle
#Name[de]=Vorlage

# Replace "command" with the actual command or script:
Exec=command param

# Where <param> may be:
# omitted	If no parameter is given the command will be executed in the
#        current folder. If a parameter is given but the current folder
#        does not contain any files, the command will not be run.
#
# %f	 A single file name, even if multiple files are selected. The
#        system reading the desktop entry should recognize that the program in
#        question cannot handle multiple file arguments, and it should should
#        probably spawn and execute multiple copies of a program for each
#        selected file if the program is not able to handle additional file
#        arguments. If files are not on the local file system (i.e. are on HTTP
#        or FTP locations), the files will be copied to the local file system
#        and %f will be expanded to point at the temporary file. Used for
#        programs that do not understand the URL syntax.
#
# %F	A list of files. Use for apps that can open several local files
#       at once. Each file is passed as a separate argument to the executable
#       program.
#
# %u	A single URL. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or
#       as file path.
#
# %U	A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to
#       the executable program. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs
#       or as file path.
#
# %%    Percent sign. Use anywhere you want '%' to appear in your command.

# Change the following line to point to an icon of your choosing
Icon=gtk-file

# Use the following to only show this menu entry if the command is installed
#TryExec=command
