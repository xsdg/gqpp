    Nvidia drivers.
    
    This patch disables Clutter if the system is liable to this bug. The
    user is given the possibility to override this with an option in

    The code must be re-written to remove deprecated functions and to use

    Ref #676: Simultaneous runs of geeqie interfere with each other
    
    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/676
    
    Fix some bugs relating to the way files and folders are handled in a
    --remote command line.

    Ref #744: Support Canon cr3 files
    
    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/744
    
    This is a temporary solution.
    The code is a copy of image_load_jpeg.c, with addresses modified to suit
    .cr3 files.
    Instead of following pointers to the start of the full size jpeg, a
    fixed address is used.
    
    No doubt at some time someone will write a proper decoder.

    Fix #713: Image preview does not update when pressing shift-up
    
    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/713
    
    When multiple images were selected, when the selection was changed GTK
    triggers the selection function on every item selected in turn.
    This resulted in the last item in the list being shown as the selected
    image.
    The code now uses the GtkTree cursor location.

    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/598
    
    With GTK2 shift+drag moved the target, control+drag copied the target,
    and no modifier key caused a pop-up menu to appear.
    With GTK3 the modifier keys are not recognized correctly.
    This patch reinstates the previous functionality.

    Allow to disable trash completely
    
    The posibilito to not use trash at all was lost with implementation of
    system trash.
    
    However, usually one does not want the system to keep megabytes of trash
    lying around. That option allows to switch trash of completely.
    
    The implementation, however, is a bit dirty, maybe someone else has a
    better Idea to do it.

    Tell Git to ignore .desktop files globally

    template.desktop file, so:
    
    * Have Git ignore all *.desktop files.
    * Rename template.desktop to template.desktop.in to
      avoid a clash with this new ignore rule.
    * Remove the checked-in image-crop.desktop file, which is built
      anyway.

    Fix #437:  Delete to standard Trash directory
    
    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/437
    
    The method of file deletion is changed. The Preferences/Behaviour option
    "Safe delete" is removed.
    
    The user has the option to choose Geeqie-defined trash bin or
    system-defined trash bin as the normal mode - set in
    Preferences/Behaviour.
    
    Menus have two entries: Move to trash and Permanent delete.
    
    The Delete key moves to trash; shift-Delete deletes permanently.
    
    Both Move to trash and Permanent delete have user-selectable
    confirmation, set in Preferences/Behaviour.
    
    This means the function of the Delete key is changed from Permanent
    delete to Move to trash, which is a fail-safe change.

    Avoid non-portable == for the test command
    
    The test command doesn't accept `==` as operator. It should be a single `=` for portable use. The `==` is a gnu extension.
    
    Note that the x-trick hasn't been needed for a long, long time. You can reliably write it with quotes:
    ```
    if test "$gtk3" = yes; then
    ```
    but I left that alone since it doesn't hurt other than being ugly.

    Remove ZoneDetect .bin file from repository
    
    A Debian maintainer has pointed out that Debian does not permit .bin
    files in the packages they create.
    The ZoneDetect database file, timezone21.bin has therefore been removed
    from the repository.
    
    New users must download the .bin file themself if they require UTC/DST
    time offset.
    
    This situation exists because the ZoneDetect developer has not yet put
    the source code for the database generator onto GitHub - when that
    happens, the database file will be generated by Geeqie (using the
    ZoneDetect sources) during the installation procedure.

    Collection preview
    
    If the folder containing collection files (usually
    $HOME/.local/share/geeqie/collections) is opened, the image pane will
    show a montage of the thumbnails (to a maximum of 20) of the images in
    the selected collection.
    Requires ImageMagick.
    
    This is a simplistic implementation, and should be improved e.g.
    
    Use collect-io.c to parse the collection file
    Use cached thumbnails instead of re-creating
    Use Geeqie to create the montage instead of using ImageMagick

    Bug fix: Info sidebar width in GTK3
    
    In bar_size_allocate() the width obained is the allocated width. In GTK2
    this is the actual width. In GTK3 it is the *minimum* width. This
    results in the info sidebar being able to increase, but not decrease.
    There does not seem to be a way in GTK3 to get the actual width of a
    widget. For GTK3 the only way is to disable it. The width of the sidebar
    is therefore not preserved across restarts.

    Fix #192: tiff files (and others) appear blurry when 1:1 view
    
    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/192
    
    Up to commit 808d8558b3d5 alpha-channel files at scale 1:1 always had
    GdkInterpType set to GDK_INTERP_NEAREST - the lowest quality. As there
    was no scaling, this was ok.
    Thereafter scaling was set to that selected by the user, resulting in
    problems when GDK_INTERP_HYPER was selected.
    This commit reverts to the previous method.

commit e67dcc4f
Author: Omari Stephens <xsdg@xsdg.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 27 20:35:59 2016 +0000

    Revamp pan view filtering to support different modes and grouping.
    
    Conceptually, the filter is a sequence of filter elements, which are considered
    in order for each image in the pan view.  The end result is that each image is
    either rejected or displayed as normal.

commit 91062845

commit fddcfa7f
Author: Omari Stephens <xsdg@xsdg.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 25 08:25:13 2016 +0000

    Adds a keyword filtering feature to Timeline PanView.
    
    UI needs some work, and currently only supports intersection between multiple
    keywords.  Would be easy to support keyword unions, if the UI supported it.
    
    Should probably hide the button in modes that don't yet support it.

commit f640a7a5
Author: Omari Stephens <xsdg@xsdg.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 24 22:37:21 2016 +0000

    Pull the search UI construction code out into a distinct function.
    
    Also, it looks like the existing code would just leak the search UI widgets.
    Having the construction code in a distinct function makes it much easier to
    ensure the appropriate cleanup happens as well.

commit b2335bb9
Author: Omari Stephens <xsdg@xsdg.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 24 05:23:02 2016 +0000

    Start moving pan view search code to its own module
    
    Next step is to pull the construction of the Search UI into the module
    as well.  Ideally, pan-view.c should just instantiate a Search thing,
    without having to worry about exactly how it's constructed or destructed.

commit 101f1bab
Author: Colin Clark <colin.clark@cclark.uk>
Date:   Thu May 4 19:06:48 2017 +0100

    Bug fix: Re-size images in GTK3
    
    When compiled with GTK3 if an image is opened with "View in new window"
    the minimum window size is determined by the image size and screen size
    etc. If a file selection is opened, the minimum window size is set by
    the first image displayed.
    This feature is determined by a call to gtk_widget_set_size_request().
    
    When compiled with GTK2, the call to gtk_widget_set_size_request() seems
    to be ignored, and the window can be resized at will.
    
    The GTK2 style is much more practical, so the call to
    gtk_widget_set_size_request() is ignored in GTK3.

    The intention is to make it easy for the user to make a comparison
    beteen the actual and auto-rotated view as an aid to detecting
    orientations made erroneously e.g. scanned images which have been
    mirrored by mistake.
    
    Expanded documentation on rotation commands.

commit 58d397ef
Author: Omari Stephens <xsdg@xsdg.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 24 05:38:38 2016 +0000

    Move pan-view components to their own subdir.
    
    This makes it easier to modularize pan-view without cluttering the src dir
    with extra files, and without worrying as much about exposing pan-view-internal
    APIs to the rest of Geeqie.

    Fixing Memory leak
    
    I also suffer from what I believe is this bug. It was not present in
    geeqie 1.0 and was simple for me to reproduce in 1.2+. I open a
    directory containing a few thousand jpg files of around 100k each and
    just keep hitting the key for "Next Image". After around a minute my
    computer will freeze.
    
    Given this reproducibility, I ran git bisect and found the commit that
    introduced the behaviour for me was the following
    
        commit b4c4a924121c3aa6b2f1eb7570dd3f419d2f4d83

            use cairo for drawing
    
    I then noticed what I think is a missing cairo_destroy call in
    cellrenderericon.c. The following patch solves the problem completely
    for me as far as I can tell.

    Bug Fix #233 Custom Border
    
    https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/issues/233
    
    In the change from v1.1 to v1.2 (GTK3 and cairo were part of this), the
    custom border was ignored and simply set to black.
    Perhaps it was not possible to get a "good" solution with the current
    design.
    Possibly this change is not the best solution, but nevertheless it
    should be sufficient until a better version is produced.

    This commit adds four new preferences:
    * Whether to use saved window positions also for new windows (in case saved
    window positions are enabled),
    * Whether to enable navigation by left or middle click on image,
    * Ability to set keyboard scrolling step multiplier,
    * Whether list directory view uses single click to enter a directory or
    GTK+ activation default (which is currently a double click).
    
    Default values of all these preferences have been set in a such way to not
    cause any changes in behavior for existing users.

    Fix hidden directories not showing in a tree view
    
    Directory tree view contains code that when "Show hidden files or folders"
    option is not enabled but the user enters a path containing hidden
    directories the missing tree entries are added automatically.
    
    This didn't work (at least) in case when the first hidden directory in
    newly selected path was in a current directory because the tree populating
    function exited early when directory contents did not change since last
    run, before checking for this special case.
    
    Fix this by skipping this check when we have to add such hidden directory
    entry.
    
    This check must also be skipped when 'force' flag is passed to this
    function, otherwise when enabling "Show hidden files or folders" option
    the missing directories are not added to the tree until Geeqie is
    restarted.

    Any file between 2^31 and 2^32 bytes shouldn't have its size displayed

    is only a matter of using 64bit arithmetic when calculating allocation
    sizes and pointers into that memory. Multiplying is always suspicious.

    Allow to configure rotation invariance

commit 49df4e25
Author: Cyril Roussillon <>
Date:   Fri May 13 13:43:41 2016 +0100

    Slightly better similarity samples
    
    Slight modification of the image_sim_fill_data, that creates the
    similarity signature. When the image size is not a multiple of 32, all
    cells had size w/32, so the last w%32 pixels were just ignored, and more
    importantly it was not symmetric at all when the signature was built
    from the other side, which is annoying for my comparison algorithm. So I
    changed the cell size (x_inc) from a constant one to
    "round(w_left/n_left)", in order to spread the spare pixels (eg to split
    42 pixels into 4 cells, it results in 11,10,11,10 instead of
    10,10,10,10). With an image of size w with w%32=16, my
    rotation-invariant algorithm results in a similarity of
    0.951000 with the original version, and 0.999968 with this modification
    (apparently lossless jpeg rotation is not perfectly lossless).

    The most problematic thing was the `gdk_window_set_override_redirect`
    call. That was what made most of the mess. Another bad idea was to deny
    resizing of the fullscreen window, which causes window manager to fail
    to adjust window size to screen size.

    However, the newly introduced function file_data_new_group() is very
    expensive. Having it in collection (in sort manager) where the dirs of
    that files have huge amount of files inside, that is simply blocking
    whole geeqie.
    
    It might be that the file_data_new_group() function need to be disarmed
    on other places too.

    Feature Request #70 Navigation menu option and button for parent directory
    
    This request was made some years ago:
    
    https://sourceforge.net/p/geeqie/feature-requests/70/
    
    I have attached a patch which implements this. Also, keyboard-only users
    will be able to use keyboard-accelerators to map a key to the Up function.
    
    Unfortunately there is a usability problem. If the configuration file
    geeqirc.xml exists (which it will except for first-time installations)
    geeqie will not look at the programmed defaults, but will create the
    toolbar from the config file - and the Up icon will not be displayed.
    
    If the user first executes a command such as this:
    
    sed -i '/toolitem action = "Back"/a <toolitem action = "Up" />'
    ~/.config/geeqie/geeqierc.xml
    
    then all will be well.
    
    This is not ideal, but I see no other solution.

    Add filedata counting to watch for filedata leaks
    
    This basically counts the number of filedata instances in existence at
    any given point in time.  If the number doesn't drop down to where it's
    supposed to be, there are leaks.

commit 710b009f
Author: Omari Stephens <xsdg@xsdg.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 12 06:03:02 2012 +0000

    Add "lock" functionality to keep FileDatas in memory
    
    Adds two primitives to keep a FileData in memory even after its refcount
    drops to zero.  Intended to be used in situations when an entire group of
    FileDatas _should_ stay in memory as an optimization, even if the code
    would continue to function properly even if the FileData were freed.

commit f5e2bc6a
Author: Vladimir Nadvornik <nadvornik@suse.cz>
Date:   Wed Aug 29 23:27:52 2012 +0200

    better filedata ref debug messages
    
    The idea is this:
    with --debug=2 geeqie writes log with pointers. If it crashes on
    fd->magick, it writes the invalid pointer as a hex value before
    the crash. Then the log can be grepped for this value to see
    what happened with this fd in the past.

commit 92c6523d
Author: Juuso Räsänen <juusora@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 23 00:38:40 2010 +0100

    Allow to sort files according to Exif-date
    
    I also like the idea about sorting files according to Exif-date. This
    behaviour seemed to be implemented in the pan-view but not in the main
    browser view. I created a little patch to "correct" this issue.  ;)
    
    This satisfies my own needs, although the exif-date reading could be
    probably somehow optimised(?).. now the GUI becomes unresponsive for
    few seconds if there are a lot of pictures in the directory...

commit b73335c5
Author: Jonathan Woithe <jwoithe@physics.adelaide.edu.au>
Date:   Fri Apr 2 20:47:34 2010 +0930

    exif autorotate for proofs
    
    Find below a patch which adds auto-rotation of proof images based on image
    EXIF information.  It is a revision of a proof-of-concept patch I did up for
    gqview 2.0.4 which, for well documented reasons, didn't get anywhere after
    submission.  The patch below is against geeqie 1.0.
    
    The proof auto-rotation feature is controlled by a new setting in the
    "convenience" section of the image preferences dialog.  This way the
    existing behaviour is still available for those who want to use it.
    
    I find this new feature very useful when preparing proofing sheets and I
    suspect others would too.  Please consider this for inclusion in geeqie.

Author: Jonathan Woithe <jwoithe@physics.adelaide.edu.au>
Date:   Fri Apr 2 20:47:34 2010 +0930

    exif autorotate for proofs
    
    Find below a patch which adds auto-rotation of proof images based on image
    EXIF information.  It is a revision of a proof-of-concept patch I did up for
    gqview 2.0.4 which, for well documented reasons, didn't get anywhere after
    submission.  The patch below is against geeqie 1.0.
    
    The proof auto-rotation feature is controlled by a new setting in the
    "convenience" section of the image preferences dialog.  This way the
    existing behaviour is still available for those who want to use it.
    
    I find this new feature very useful when preparing proofing sheets and I
    suspect others would too.  Please consider this for inclusion in geeqie.

    the issue was caused by a return NULL on unreadable file, before initializinf exif_cache
    and when exif_free_fd() is called, file_cache_put() was called on invalid cache.

    Fix bug 2999830: do not report failed chown() on copy.
    
    Debian bug 574853 reported by Ian Zimmerman <itz@buug.org>
    
    I was trying to copy images from my camera which is mounted as a USB
    mass storage device.  The files on the mount are owned by root, and
    geeqie tries to chown (and chgrp) the copy, fails, and displays an
    error message.  This is only mildly annoying when copying a single
    file, but when I want to copy multiple files the failure stops the
    operation after the first file.
    
    Patch by Vladislav Naumov <vnaum@vnaum.com>
    
    This patch ignores chown errors, while still doing chown
    (so root still can copy files preserving ownership).

    order on lines 5601 and 5606. -- Note also: The first cache path in the
    thumbnail dialogue window appears having a duplication error.

    Allow to switch to fullscreen mode using LIRC.
    
    Imagine the following situation (which happened to me several times) :
    you want to see photos from your bed or your sofa so you launch geeqie
    and go to the right directory, then you take your remote control and sit
    comfortably far from your keyboard and mouse. And when you want to begin
    to watch photos, you realize you forgot to enable full screen! You have
    to stand up and to go until your computer and come back, whereas you
    could have done it with your remote control.

    Add compatibility for GTK 2.18
    
    With 2.18 some functions are deprecated. With geeqie that are two at the
    moment.
    - gtk_tree_view_column_get_cell_renderers - which can be replaced by
      gtk_cell_layout_get_cells
    - gdk_event_get_graphics_expose - I just commented it as there seems to
      be no replacement in GTK 2.18

Author: Vladimir Nadvornik <nadvornik@suse.cz>
Date:   Thu Oct 1 18:40:34 2009 +0000

    ignored multiple directories specified on commandline
    
    IMHO this was inconsistent - specifying one directory had completely
    different effect than specifying two or more directories. Moreover,
    it segfaulted.
    Now only one directory is allowed.

      like in img-view.

commit d820c538
Author: Klaus Ethgen <Klaus@Ethgen.de>
Date:   Sun Jun 21 22:52:08 2009 +0000

    Fix two memory failures
    
    1. if the description field for a exif information is empty the program
       dumps core when trying to change this. The reason is a strcmp with a
       NULL value.
    
       The fix add the small functionality to set the field to default when
       it is set empty.
    
    2. There was a g_strdup miss in exif.c which could end in memory
       corruption.

    NOTES: (To be fixed in autoconf)
       - LIRC must be explicit _enabled_ instead of disable. This is wrong

       - It might be a good idea to derivate the readmedir and the htmldir
         from docdir.

commit 0977d77b
Author: Klaus Ethgen <Klaus@Ethgen.de>
Date:   Fri Apr 10 10:18:42 2009 +0000

    Fix the broken statistic generation
    
    The output of msgfmt has different format if no fuzzy translations (or
    even no translated) are available. I fixed that by parsing the output of
    msgfmt more intelligent.
    
    Drawback of the solution is that the parsing will not work if the output
    of msgfmt use not the strings "translated messages", "fuzzy
    translations" and "untranslated messages".

    Add pgettext for some ambiguous strings
    
    There are some strings which are ambiguous to translate. There is the
    pgettext function to solf that problem.
    
    For example, locations can be translated to german by Ortsangaben
    (geographical) or by Pfad (filesystem). I am sure there are also some
    ambiguous in other languages.

commit 14946850
Author: Laurent Monin <zas@norz.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 6 22:13:54 2009 +0000

    Fix up event source ids type: gint -> guint.
    Functions like g_timeout_add() or g_idle_add() return a guint
    greater than 0, but in most places it was wrongly stored as int
    and initialized to -1.
    This broke assertions matching in g_source_remove() for example
    since id was always greater than 0 even when timer was not set
    (-1 was casted to the biggest guint).

Author: Laurent Monin <zas@norz.org>

    Implement preliminary support for XDG Base Directory Specification.
    See http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html.
    
    This feature was requested for a long time (feature requests #1950978 and #2289481).
    For now, it is disabled since it breaks compatibility with previous versions.
    To be able to test it, you have to enable it by defining USE_XDG to 1 in main.h.
    
    geeqierc and other conf files are going to:
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/geeqie/ (default to $HOME/.config/geeqie/).
    
    metadata and thumbnails cache (if std is not used) are going to:
    $XDG_CACHE_HOME/geeqie/metadata/ (default to $HOME/.cache/geeqie/metadata/)
    and $XDG_CACHE_HOME/geeqie/thumbnails/ (default to $HOME/.cache/geeqie/thumbnails/)
    
    collections are going to:
    $XDG_DATA_HOME/geeqie/collections/ (default to $HOME/.local/share/geeqie/collections/)
    
    
    Please test and report any issue.

commit a5760993
Author: Laurent Monin <zas@norz.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 6 20:01:32 2008 +0000

    Previous patch (revision 1185) for the comments-related segfault was incomplete, and as such, it broke keywords in files whose metadata had keywords but no comments.
    
    This patch fixes that (and still fixes the case where one searches on
    comments and hits a file with keywords but no comments).  Lastly, I would
    imagine that there exists a failure mode where one searches for a keyword and
    hits a file with a comment but no keyword, and I imagine this patch should fix
    that case as well.
    
    Patch by Omari Stephens (aka xsdg).

commit c658a3d3
Author: Laurent Monin <zas@norz.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 24 20:24:04 2008 +0000

    Set GIO channels to binary encoding.
    This is needed since messages from commands may not be UTF8-encoded
    and g_io_channel_read_chars() may incorrectly interpret some characters.
    In practice it was truncating some ISO-8859-1 messages containing some
    french characters. This fixes it.

    These options can only be changed from the rc file, not at runtime.
    Tests are made to check that shell.path is not empty and lead to
    an executable file.

    It allows to have names like "prefix_12" and "prefix_something" in the same file.
    Using strtol() was wrong since it allowed names like "prefix_-0xa", leading
    to unpredictable results. It was wrong too with "prefix_something", which
    was equivalent to "prefix_0", instead of being an option of its own.

commit 0cbf3280
Author: Laurent Monin <zas@norz.org>
Date:   Sat May 10 21:29:53 2008 +0000

    Fix display of collection in overlay info.
    Due to markup escaped <i>collection</i> was displayed instead of collection's in italic.
    
    Overlay info syntax was extended to allow the wrapping of displayed data with markup.
    
    General syntax is: %name[:length limit][:extra]%
    Extra string uses special character '*' to mark the place of the data to display.
    If no '*' is present, then extra string is just appended to data.
    Any "\n" is replaced by a newline on display.
    Pango mark up is accepted in left and right parts.
    If data is empty, nothing will be displayed.
    
    Examples:
    "%name:<i>*</i>\n%" -> name is displayed in italics ended with a newline
    "%size:\n%"         -> size is displayed with a newline at end
    "%formatted.ISOSpeedRating:ISO *%"      -> prefix iso number with "ISO " (ie. "ISO 100")
    "Collection <b>*</b>\n" -> display collection name in bold prefixed by "Collection " and a newline is appended
    
    
    Collection name formatting was slighly improved by not displaying the .gqv extension.
    The default overlay info string was modified to use the new syntax, but older info strings should be
    displayed as usual.

    Triggering it will either result in an assertion failure or a
    segfault.
    
    To reproduce:
    - open a collection
    - right-click on a non-selected image
    - select Delete... menu entry (or Copy, Move, Rename, Properties...)
    
    It results in the best case:
    ** ERROR **: file filelist.c: line 905 (file_data_ref): assertion failed: (fd->magick == 0x12345678)
    or a pure segfault due to corrupted data.
    
    collection_table_popup_file_list() has to return a list of filedata *
    not a list of gchar *.

    image_overlay.common.enabled => to save last state to rc file
    image_overlay.common.show_at_startup => overrides .common.enabled at startup
    image_overlay.common.template_string => replace fullscreen.info
    
    common is used since for now there is only one image overlay setup,
    later specific setups may be added.

	high priority idle sync is no longer called before the treeview tries
	to redraw itself, so fix the cleanup of removed pointers so that they
	are always valid or NULL (I wonder if the priorities used by
	GtkTreeView have changed in newer versions of GTK?).

	before thumbnail generation is finished.

	overlays are now ugly.

Wed Nov  8 11:36:58 2006  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* format_canon.h, format_fuji.h: Update to new #define format.
	* format_fuji.c: Use same offset for Exif as the jpeg image as the
	Exif is always embedded in the jpeg and assuming offset of 12 is
	just broken.
	* format_nikon.h: Update to new #define format, and add pentax here
	as finding the jpeg will be same code.
	* format_olympus.[ch]: Support Olympus raw files with embedded jpegs,
	not all raw files will have a jpeg, but all appear to have Exif tags.

	* pixbuf-renderer.c: Fix pixbuf_renderer_set_tiles_size() so that
	canvas will not treat scroll position as if a new image was set, this
	fixes popups in the Pan View from causing a scroll to the top left or
	center when scroll_reset_method is not set to 'no change'. Also clean
	up pr_pixbuf_set() and pr_zoom_sync() arguments, some were unused or
	always set TRUE as they were old cruft.

	improvement on jpegs.

	duplicated in three places into thumb_loader_std_next_source. Added
	retry flag to force a retry on images that are flagged as a failure.

	cache operations for removing old thumbnails, deleting thumbnails, and

	maintenance window instead of purge utility.

	functions.
	* globals.c: Change default thumb size to 96x72, add
	thumbnail_spec_standard to toggle use of new thumbnail cache.
	* gqview.h, main.c: Add extern for thumbnail_spec_standard and change
	use of float to double.
	* image-load.[ch]: Use doubles instead of floats for progress value.
	* image.[ch]: Use doubles everywhere in place of floats, hence zoom is
	now a double.
	* layout.[ch], layout_image.[ch]: More float to double changes.
	* preferences.c: Change selection of thumbnail sizes offered to user,
	and allow a custom item when the thumbnail size configured in the
	rc file does not match the predefined list. Added toggle for new
	shared thumbnail standard (option needs a better description?)
	* print.c: Update for image zoom now being a double.
	* rcfile.c: Save and restore thumbnail_spec_standard.
	* search.c: More float to double change madness, and update for new
	thumb functions.
	* similar.[ch]: More floats to doubles.
	* thumb.[ch]: Updated the thumb function API to something a bit more
	sane, but mostly to match that of thumb_standard.h. When the standard
	thumb loaders are enabled thumb_loader_new will now return a loader
	from thumb_loader_std_new - the function access to thumb loaders is the
	same but the structures are completely different - don't access the
	structure directly. Also removed unused utility functions in thumbs.c.
	* thumb_standard.[ch]: New utilities for a thumb loader that implements
	the proposed thumbnail management standard on freedesktop.org.
	* typedefs.h: ThumbLoader is now treated as an opaque structure (but
	no attempt is made to hide it) because there are now two thumb loader
	implementations (thumb.c and thumb_standard.c). We check which loader
	and structure is in use with the standard_loader flag common to each. 
	* view_file_icon.[ch], view_file_list.[ch]: Change floats to doubles
	and updates for new thumb functions.

	the search feature of the GTkTreeViews, as it interferes with shortcuts
	for the main window and elsewhere, also when it is enabled set the
	search column.

	of the treeview search feature has changed such that it can now get
	in the way when it is not specifically disabled.

Thu Dec 30 00:17:31 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* collect-io.c: Keep a pointer to the tail of the pending action list
	so that each append does not require walking the list.

Wed Dec 29 23:08:01 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	contained in $HOME/.gqview/collections when files are moved. Made

	before exit.

Mon Dec 27 16:50:50 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	line option. Fix crash when quitting from a remote --quit command.

	so that an immediate call to image_loader_free does not do bad things.
	Protect against calling image_loader_start more than once on a loader.

	* bar_exif.c, bar_info.c, bar_sort.c: Make sidebar titles bold.

	* image.c: Assume any request to resize the top window (per fit window
	to image option) will fail, and request a direct redraw - this works
	because we also changed the idle redraw handler's priority from
	G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE to GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW so that it now has a lower
	priority than the resize signal. This fixes the fvwm2 maximized window
	does not redraw bug - the fault never was with fvwm2, although it would
	be nice if it set the maximized flag when windows are maximized :/.

Tue Nov 16 03:44:30 2004  John Ellis  <johne@verizon.net>

	* image.c, typedefs.h: Remove GtkEventbox used for image displays, as
	it is not necessary with GtkDrawingArea. Also removed GTK double

	displayed/drawn synchonously with GTK expose events.

	vdtree_populate_path_by_iter() before accessing something it may free,
	and use a zero length string ("") for the placeholder node path/name,
	as there shouldn't be any folders with that name to encounter...

Tue Sep 24 16:46:10 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* view_file_icon.c: Do not pop up the filename tooltip if the window
	does not have the focus (fixes popping up when in fullscreen).
	* layout_image.c: The window and tools window should always be
	sensitive, even in fullscreen, since some users have Xinerama and could
	therefore still be able to use the main/tools window.

Tue Sep 24 16:14:22 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c, img-view.c, layout_image.c, layout_util.c: Fixed window
	title to remove the " - " part when no image is viewed. Also made the
	exit using control-Q consitent, hooked up control-P for image
	properties, and fixed it to drop out of full screen when showing the
	image properties window. (note that fullscreen is not intended for
	'file management' use, therefore new windows will not work correctly
	when displayed from fullscreen, so the mode is exited.)
	* collect.c, dups.c: Hooked up Control-P to properties.
	* README: Documented Ctrl-P properties window shortcut.

Tue Sep 24 14:20:15 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

Sat Sep 21 08:02:22 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* thumb.c: Broken images are now marked with a 0 byte thumb file, so
	that regeneration is not reattempted until the timestamp changes.
	Also added (better) debugging output for thumb code.

Sat Sep 21 06:45:28 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* view_file_icon.c(vficon_maint_removed): If the removed file is the 1
	actively being thumbnailed, set the thumbnail pointer to NULL so that
	the thumb routines will ignore this cycle (instead of trying to use it
	along with the freed memory!).
	* view_file_list.c(vflist_maint_removed): Ditto.

Wed Jul  3 08:08:41 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Changes for upgrade to gettext 0.11.1
	* autogen.sh: More gettextize command line options.
	* po/Makevars: New file for the new gettext - MANY cursing and
	complaint lines removed from ChangeLog that could have been simply
	avoided by adding upgrade notes to the gettext README!
	* po/*.po: Make distcheck with new gettext did this, plus a few fixes
	that the new gettext complains about (and fails on).

	list for correct scroll point.
	* view_file_list.c: Fixed refresh causing odd scroll point jumping.

	classic behavior of changing the path not effecting the displayed
	image. The new behavior is now to view the first image in the new
	path (many users wanted this - to enable old behavior set
	lazy_image_sync to true in gqviewrc).
	* main.c(main): Fixes to work with new non lazy image changing.

Sun Jun  9 20:26:47 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout_image.c: Set the main window (and tools) insensitive when

	display the subdirectories.

Sun Jun  9 19:30:07 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	for the main window. Also fixed pane positioning bug causing panes to
	move to 1,1 when user holds down h or f to hide or float the tools.

Wed Jun  5 19:38:40 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: Added test for Xinerama.
	* fullscreen.c: Added Xinerama support based on patch from
	"Jrg Mensmann" <joerg.mensmann@gmx.de>
	(untested - do not have Xinerama display - NVidia's twinview does not
	support it with tv out as the second device - crash :/ )
	* Makefile.am(LD_ADD): Added Xinerama lib var.
	* view_file_list.c: Some crash fixes when refreshing the file view. Of
	note make sure nothing is selected until the clist is completely
	synced, and guard against vflist_index_get_data returning NULL,
	although that should no longer happen during the refresh.

Fri May 24 18:39:03 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout.c(layout_style_set): NULL widget pointers before destroying
	them, as the group box destruction will cause attempts to update

	* info.c: Added drag and drop support to info window (as source only).

	* layout_util.[ch]: Added new window menu item to create another main
	window, along with the companion close window menu item.

Wed May  1 19:18:04 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dnd.[ch]: Removed image specific dnd functions (moved to img-view.c,
	as that is the only place that used them).
	* img-view.c: Dropping a list a of files onto the window now remembers
	the entire list, they can be navigated as in the main window and used
	to start a slideshow for that window. Dropped directories also pop up
	a menu requesting the actions, similar to the duplicates and
	collection window drag and drop stuff.
	* img-view.h: Added view_window_new_from_list.

Wed May  1 16:45:22 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c(image_zoom_adjust_real): Removed the rounding hack when
	incrementing the zoom from the 'fit to window' (zoom == 0.0) state. It
	was a broken attempt to clamp the zoom to the increment size, which,
	upon further review is really just unexpected behavior and breaks
	when the increment size is larger than the resulting fit window scale.
	(surprised no one saw this earlier, it has been this way since pre 1.0)
	* preferences.c(zoom_increment_cb): Fix for converting float to int.

Mon Apr 29 22:04:56 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	image within a collection when deleting files, and a collection member
	is the actively viewed image.
	* view_file_icon.c, view_file_list.c: In the maintenance removed utils
	consider that the viewed image may be a collection member.

Mon Apr 29 16:18:13 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c: Added support of %f escape to insert filenames anywhere
	within the editor command line.
	* rcfile.c(save_options): Remove brain dead fprintf that could result
	in writing random memory to the config file by simply specifying an
	printf format escape in an editor slot (oops).

Mon Apr 29 15:12:02 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* [GTK2 port]

	size.
	* main.c: gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file now has a gerror parameter, and the
	gtk_item_factory_dump_rc plus friends seem to be gone, so disabled it.
	* preferences.c: Fixes button box spacing and about label justify.
	* ui_help.c, ui_tabcomp.c, ui_utildlg.c: Fixes needed copied from the
	slik GTK2 port.

	* view_file_icon.c: Fixes for gtk_widget_popup removal and to return
	values so that drag and drop works.
	* view_file_list.c: Fixes for pulling the GdkFont from a style.
	* configure.in: Use new gtk2 checks.
	* src/Makefile.am: Removed gdk-pixbuf flags as it is now part of gtk2.

Fri Apr 26 00:30:02 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	so that ctrl-mouse wheel zooming stays relative to the mouse position.

Sun Apr 21 01:16:53 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* layout.c, typedefs.h: The active path of the main window is now
	checked for a timestamp change, is so call a refresh.

	* info.c (info_window_new): Remove unused vbox variable.
	* pixbuf_util.c: Made some small optimizations for the pixbuf rotation
	functions (appears roughly 2-3x faster, could probably be further

	option, on by default.
	* image.c, typedefs.h: Implemented two pass zooming, also tried to
	throttle the image buffer size for larger image files - but left it
	#defined out for now, the buffer size needs to be calcualted better
	than mulitplying by 8 :)

	* image.c: Removed the old debugging defines.

Wed Apr 17 12:02:36 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

Tue Apr  9 23:54:52 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: Fixed the reversed addition of matches that has been around
	since the beginning of time. (Fix absolutely needed now for the rank
	numbers to make any real sense.)

Tue Apr  9 23:17:38 2002  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	the real ratio of disk size to memory size.

	improvements in compares from 2 to 3.5 times faster. Tried to improve

	filelist.c to use this in future), also fixed the clist_moveto calls
	to use a valid column number (-1).

	to delete files. Also added a New Directory button to create new

	of the window.
	* globals.c, gqview.h, main.c, rcfile.c, window.c: Added saving of
	the divider position between dirs and files. Also fixed a bug that
	attempting to get the tool window size when it was not visible.

Thu Apr  5 16:38:23 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.[ch]: Fixed path_list_filter() to do checks on the file
	name, not full path. Also added is_dir_list which will not do the
	check for the extension on directory lists.
	* collect-table.c, dupe.c, menu.c: Fixes for the above, and also added
	additional filtering for the duplicates window.

Thu Apr  5 15:41:02 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: Release 0.11.0

Tue Mar 20 13:25:04 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Added #define option to use faster zooming method. Also
	attempted to fix shrinking window bug - failed.
	* README: Updated.
	* po/zh_TW.Big5.po: Updated Traditional Chinese translation, submitted
	by Abel Cheung <deaddog@deaddog.ws>.

Thu Mar 15 16:49:11 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: Freeze dw->second_clist when adding files.

Thu Mar 15 14:14:26 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: Minor window file count fix.
	* thumb.c: Use xvpics (if enabled) only as a last resort when
	searching for a pre-existing thumbnail.

Wed Mar 14 08:50:00 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Added option to compare between two different sets of
	files (very useful when checking a handful of new files to a known
	unique group). Also set the default window width back to 600.

Thu Mar  8 10:35:25 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gqview.h, image.c: Went back to 0.10.0 method of using
	gdk_pixbuf_composite_color() for every quality except NEAREST for
	images without transparency. Also disabled the TILES option for zooming
	all together - my little test scenario now crashes with the new
	gdk-pixbuf (0.10.0).  -- maybe I do have a bug floating around the
	scaling compuations somewhere, but damn if I can find it.

Thu Mar  8 10:14:32 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in, gqview.h, image.c: Made quick non-public package so
	that anyone interested in fixing gdk-pixbuf's gdk_pixbuf_scale() can
	try the fixes with GQview. (all broken scaling methods are enabled in
	this version).

Thu Mar  8 09:52:01 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* po/es.po: Updates Spanish translation, from
	Rodrigo Sancho Senosiain <ruy_ikari@bigfoot.com>
	* dupe.c: Made the default window 20 pixels wider.

Thu Mar  8 09:28:09 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in, gqview.spec.in: Require gdk-pixbuf 0.10.0 or newer.
	* gqview.h, image.c, preferences.c, rcfile.c: Use the fixed simple
	scaling of gdk-pixbuf 0.10.0, also disabled the TILES zoom quality
	option until this is fixed in gdk-pixbuf (assuming it is a gdk-pixbuf
	bug, as the other qualities work fine - ask for test case of image
	sizes if anyone is interested in fixing this).

Wed Feb 28 16:40:02 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-dlg.c, collect.c, dupe.c, img-view.c, preferences.c,
	utilops.c, window.c: Use GQview as the window class, as X man page
	encourages capitalization of first letter, and this removes conflict
	of gqview for instance of main window.

Mon Feb 26 15:39:15 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* po/zh_CN.GB2312.po: Added simplified Chinese translation, from
	Wu Yulun <migr@operamail.com>.
	* README, TODO, gqview.spec.in: Updated.
	* configure.in: Release 0.10.1

Sat Feb 24 05:39:53 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c (path_list_recursive): Return NULL, not FALSE.
	(it's a pointer)
	* img-main.c (main_image_slideshow_start_from_list): Free the
	path_list before returning if slideshow is already running.
	* slideshow.c (real_slideshow_start): Fix test of path_list before
	return of NULL.

Sat Feb 24 03:46:12 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.c: Fix to support image loaders that do not have a
	pixbuf until the the loader is actually closed. (This should fix
	thumbnail generation failures for xpm and tiff).
	* similar.c (image_sim_fill_data): Fix to support generation of data
	for images with dimensions less than 32 x 32.

Thu Feb 22 08:44:38 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* cache.c: Added blurb about the SIMcache file format.
	* dupe.c: Properly ref/unref clist row styles.

Thu Feb 22 07:54:12 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Operations now give a (very rough) estimate of time left
	before completion of the comparison stage.

Thu Feb 22 05:47:17 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* cache.[ch]: New files to handle the caching placement/management
	stuff. Also location of reading and writing of the dupe window cache
	data.
	* dupe.c: Added caching of file data (dimensions, checksum,
	and similarity).
	* filelist.c, menu.c: Namespace update for cache maintenance.
	* globals.c, gqview.h, preferences.c, rcfile.c: Added option to save
	cache data into direct subdir of source (.thumbnails support).
	* thumb.[ch]: Use new cache functions for locating thumbs.
	* utilops.c: Move/remove cache date when doing the same for their
	parent files.

Tue Feb 20 19:41:27 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

        * ui_fileops.[ch]: Moved include of time.h back to the .c file.
        * ui_utildlg.c: #include <sys/types.h>, this should have been the
        original fix anyway...
	* gqview.h: Added #include <sys/types.h>
	* image-load.c: Removed above include.

Mon Feb 19 17:26:23 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gqview.1, README: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.10.0

Sun Feb 18 08:08:03 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* ui_utildlg.[ch]: Real fix for enter activating wrong widgets, now
	you must set it manually with generic_dialog_attach_default(). Note
	that file_dialog_add_path_widgets() does this automatically.
	* utilops.c: Added a few attaches, from above.

Sun Feb 18 07:32:04 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* ui_utildlg.c (generic_dialog_key_press_cb): Only call the default
	function upon press of enter while a gtkentry has the focus. (no
	longer conflicts with pressing enter while focused on, say a button).

Sun Feb 18 06:52:51 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c (image_draw_focus): Fixed the focus drawing to follow themes,
	since painting merely a black rectangle was very broken with some
	theme engines (and did not follow the theme).

Tue Feb 13 02:34:33 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* ui_fileops.[ch]: Fix #include of time.h (moved it to header).

Mon Feb 12 15:04:51 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README, TODO: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.5.

Mon Feb 12 05:39:30 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Makefile.am, gqview.spec.in: Added man page.
	* gqview.1: The man page, submitted by
	Ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org>
	* README: Credits for man page.

Fri Feb  9 20:26:46 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* menu.c: Use gdk-pixbuf to generate toolbar images.
	* window.c (tollwindow_hide): Retrieve the window's geometry attributes
	before hiding the window (else we get a random X BadMatch error).

Fri Feb  9 19:45:26 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* fullscreen.c: The mouse is now hidden on start of fullscreen instead
	of waiting for the 'no-move timeout'.
	* dnd.c, filelist.[ch], menu.[ch], window.c: All pop-up menus are now
	created as needed, instead of globally at start-up. Right clicking
	unselected files in the file list now highlights them. Added a right
	click menu to the dir list that includes new slideshow recursive
	feature (also standard slideshow, and find duplicates choices).
	* globals.c, gqview.h: Removed unused global menu vars (above).
	* img-main.[ch]: Added main_image_slideshow_start_from_list().

Fri Feb  9 17:02:07 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c (image_size_top_window): When checking if a resize is needed,
	compare to the window that will actually be resized (the top window).
	This was checking the wrong widget's window, and was returning TRUE
	incorrectly, subsequently causing no update if the image had the same
	size for the main window.
	* po/hu.po: Updated Hungarian translation from
	Mtys Tibor <templar@tempi.scene.hu>

Thu Feb  8 18:16:18 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added hu (Hungarian).
	* po/hu.po: Added Hungarian translation from
	Mtys Tibor <templar@tempi.scene.hu>
	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation from
	Eric Lassauge <ros_at1@muzillac.tls.mms.fr>

Thu Feb  8 17:46:00 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c (image_change_from_image): Copy all relevent data from
	source, now fullscreen toggle while loading an image works. This is
	really a move function, it moves most data from source to dest.
	Probably should add a copy function that copies pixbuf, or loads from
	scratch if still loading source.
	* img-main.c, img-view.c: Mouse wheel (b4, b5) now reverses the
	'mouse scrolls image' option when holding down shift, and also zooms
	when holding down control.
	* typedefs.h (ImageWindow): Removed crufty size_idle_id.

Thu Feb  8 16:31:57 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c (file_is_moved): Fixed bug causing moved files not to
	removed from the file list.
	* image.c (image_scroll_real): Fix race condition between expose_event
	and scrolling so that redraws are always called on the correct region.
	(This was the cause of missing redraws when scrolling with the mouse).

Thu Feb  8 15:30:14 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* img-main.c: Connect 'b' and 'p' keys to the full screen as well.

Mon Feb  5 17:37:29 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README, TODO: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.4

Mon Feb  5 17:03:27 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: Added keyboard shortcuts for the duplicates window.
	* image.c (image_change_complete): Call the update function
	explicitely if sync if FALSE.

Mon Feb  5 14:06:07 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-dlg.c, filelist.c, utilops.[ch]: Added wrappers around the
	new dialog routines to re-implement place dialogs under mouse option.
	* ui_utildlg.h: Fixed #defines for re-definition safety.

Fri Feb  2 15:36:17 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Optimized Loading of data when setuping up for a compare.
	Also speedups by using the image_sim_compare_fast() (below), and
	setting the buffer size of the image loader higher (8).
	* similar.[ch] (image_sim_compare_fast): New function that aborts when
	the return no longer has the possibility of reaching the minimim
	requested value. Significantly faster when used to search for images
	that are very close. (say, above .95).

Fri Feb  2 01:02:11 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* similar.[ch]: New files, provides functions for simple comparison
	of images by average area color content.
	* dupe.[ch]: Added similarity compare methods (normal, high, and low
	accuracy matches.) The cutoff for each is 90, 95, and 85 percent, resp.

Wed Jan 31 19:31:10 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Fixed typo in comparison of window sizes in top_window_size,
	also do not call gtk_widget_set_usize in that func, as gdk_window_size
	is enough (and avoids duplicate size events). Also only call a redraw
	if the top window was not resized, as the size event will do this for
	us.
	* img-view.c: Attached ctrl-w to close a view window.

Wed Jan 31 16:43:21 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dnd.c (get_uri_file_list): Handle file:/// as well, so that drops
	with this do not result in "///file" path names.
	* img-view.c, main.c: Added following key support: P to toggle pause
	of slideshows, B to be same as BackSpace, and 1 - 4 to set zoom level.
	Also marked debug printfs with if (debug), and and added --version
	command line option.

Tue Jan 30 20:05:36 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.[ch]: Added maintenance funcs for renamed, moved  files, etc.
	* dupe.[ch]: Added maintenance funcs (as above), also added Remove to
	the pop-up menu, and fixed the alternating color swap (now that
	individual items can be removed, the colors need to be re-synced).
	* filelist.[ch]: Added file_is_moved(), and fixes to use the
	file_maint_*() stuff.
	* img-main.[ch] (main_image_get_collection): Added this accessor.
	* utilops.[ch]: Added file_maint_*() funcs, call these when files have
	been manipulated (rename, move, delete).

Tue Jan 30 16:04:42 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.[ch]: Added ability to set the priority of the image
	loader, default is G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE (same as g_idle_add).
	* typedefs.h (ImageLoader): Added idle_priority (see above).
	* image.c: The drawing queue now uses an idle with priority
	G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE, so that redraws of the image will occur before
	anything else. (this way when scrolling a still-loading image, the
	scrolled area is updated faster)

Mon Jan 29 13:48:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-io.[ch], collect.[ch]: Const ify some arguments.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.3

Mon Jan 29 13:35:21 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.c (collection_window_new): Only load the path if it is
	absolute (starts with a '/');
	* main.c: Added -l,--list option to open a collection window with the
	files from the command line.

Mon Jan 29 12:52:19 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* menu.c: Applied patch from Zbigniew Chyla <cyba@gnome.pl> to remove
	translation markers from item_factory accessors.
	* po/pl.po: Updated Polish translation from
	Zbigniew Chyla <cyba@gnome.pl>
	* po/es.po: Updated Spanish translation (missed for 0.9.2) from
	Rodrigo Sancho Senosiain <ruy_ikari@bigfoot.com>
	* po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation (missed for 0.9.2) from
	Michael Bravo <mbravo@tag-ltd.spb.ru>
	* po/sl.po: Added Slovene translation (missed for 0.9.2) from
	Matej Erman <matej.erman@guest.arnes.si>

Thu Jan 25 21:09:10 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* utilops.c: Put the name of the file in the entry of the rename
	dialog, and select the text.
	* image.c: #ifdef some debugging output.

Thu Jan 25 15:28:08 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.c: We do not use gdk_pixbuf_loader's "area_prepared"
	signal, so make sure to retrieve the pixbuf before calling our loader's
	"area_updated" signal.
	* image.c: Added new_data status to debugging info.

Wed Jan 24 12:03:27 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect.c, dupe.c, img-view.c, window.c: Set the wmclass to all
	lowercase, and changes for new window_set_icon().
	* gqview.h, main.c (window_set_icon): Changed to use gdk_pixbuf.
	* preferences.c: Made about it's own window, and made the config window
	a little more compact.

Wed Jan 24 11:13:52 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.[ch] (path_list_filter): New function, applies filter
	options on a path list.
	* collect-table.c, dupe.c: Run path lists through the filter (above).

Wed Jan 24 00:11:15 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Use the collection's name field instead of pulling it from
	the end of the path field.
	* main.c: Multiple files on the command line are now added to a
	collection, this collection is then set to the main window viewer.

Tue Jan 23 23:08:45 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* thumb.c: Fix xvpics support: the done signal was never being sent for
	xvpics. Also made xvpics scale to the thumbnail size even when smaller.

Tue Jan 23 21:58:49 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image-load.[ch], typedefs.h: Added ability to set the size of the
	read buffer. The buffer is always 512 bytes (as before), what this
	does is set the number of time to read from the file on each idle call,
	in effect increasing the buffer size to 512 x size.
	* image.c: Fixed race condition where an image area may be ready to be
	queued before the pixbuf is set. Fixed the tile blank flag, it is now
	set correctly in all (?) cases. Set the image loader buffer size to 4,
	so that more of the image is decoded between render calls. Also removed
	unused crufty function argument for image_tile_expose.

Tue Jan 23 13:37:29 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Fix scrolling while partially obscured, and made the focus
	drawing code cleaner (removed gtk_signal_disconnect() junk).

Tue Jan 23 11:32:08 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* globals.c, gqview.h, img-main.c, img-view.c, main.c, preferences.c,
	rcfile.c: Made the delete key optional, since this is a dangerous key
	with delete confirmation disabled. Also do not come out of fullscreen
	when confirm delete is disabled. Based on patch submitted by
	Niku Toivola <niku.toivola@iki.fi>

Mon Jan 22 20:32:53 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Fix setting scale when zoom_to_fit_expands is false.
	* collect-dlg.c: Fix the missing cancel button in the overwrite confirm
	dialog for the save as dialog.
	(The good: Easy fixes. The bad: Stupid mistakes.
	 The ugly: Had not tested these before release.)

Mon Jan 22 12:09:43 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README: Updates.
	* configure.in: Release 0.9.2.

        same path in the entry when calling this.

Fri Jan 19 22:51:56 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* *.[ch]: Changed the copyright in all the files to 2001.

	* utilops.c: Fix text in copy/move dialog for multiple files.

Thu Jan 18 19:45:22 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c: When starting a compare set the status text to file count,
	gives user idea of how many files are being compared.
	* image.c: Compile clean-up.
	* po/*.po: Make distcheck touched these.

Thu Jan 18 19:22:40 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c, window.c: Fix drop down history on main window to change
	to the selected path after the popup window is hidden.
	* image.c (image_pixbuf_sync): Clear the window when set to a NULL
	pixbuf.
	* utilops.c (generic_dialog_add_images): Implemented this function.

Thu Jan 18 17:25:39 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* filelist.c: Fix sticky thumbnails when changing to a dir with files
	that have similar file names as the previous dir. Fix refresh to
	reload thumbnails (it was stalling in the thumb_next checks).
	* menu.c: Call filelist_refresh() instead of the hack to refresh by
	changing to the same dir.
	* preferences.c: Use a button box for the ok, apply, cancel buttons.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Added new files, removed missing.

Thu Jan 18 16:38:19 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* ui_clist_edit.[ch], ui_fileops.[ch], ui_menu.[ch], ui_pathsel.[ch],
	ui_tabcomp.[ch], ui_tabcomp.xpm, ui_utildlg.[ch]: New convenience files
	from SLIK.
	* clist_edit.[ch], fileops.[ch], path.[ch], tabcomp.[ch], tabcomp.xpm,
	utildlg.[ch]: Removed (see above).
	* collect-dlg.[ch], collect-io.c, collect-table.c, collect.c, dnd.c,
	dupe.c, filelist.[ch], gqview.h, image.c, img-main.[ch], img-view.[ch],
	menu.[ch], preferences.c, rcfile.c, slideshow.c, thumb.c, typedefs.h,
	utilops.[ch], window.c: Use the new convenience functions, constify
	things where needed.
	* main.c: Moved the file path utils out of here (see above).

Wed Jan 17 15:06:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.[ch]: Added fit window to image support (back in).
	* fullscreen.c, img-view.c, window.c: Fixes for above (namespaces).
	* typedefs.c (ImagwWindow): Changed zoom_enable to top_window_sync.

Tue Jan 16 13:40:29 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Scrolling while decoding a scaled image no longer causes
	dropped (black) areas. Also added an tile blank flag so that tiles
	with no loaded data simply render a black rectangle for a speed
	improvement (this is currrently semi-broken as image_tile_sync() is
	currently always called to set the blank flag to FALSE :(.

Mon Jan 15 21:53:25 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* fullscreen.c: Made the full screen window have a black background
	once again.
	* img-main.c: Enabled keyboard grab on fullscreen window, and re-grab
	the keyboard after a popup menu closes.

Sun Jan 14 17:39:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

Sun Jan 14 17:18:47 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	when I added the thumbnail column).
	* image.[ch]: Added the update functions, made them work.
	* img-main.c, img-view.c: Set the update functions, attach the windows
	for the titles.
	* window.c: Set the initial image to the logo.

Sun Jan 14 15:26:49 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dnd.c: Temporarily disable dnd highlighting for image windows.
	* gqview.h, main.c: Minor fixups.
	* image.c: Generally works now, borders are cleared, focus is handled,
	etc. TODO: Add update callback, window title updating, and window
	auto-sizing.
	* menu.c: Added missing menu item 'Zoom to fit'. (must have been missed
	during convertion to a menu_factory.
	* window.c: Moved focus draw/handling code out of here (into image.c).

Sat Jan 13 18:51:20 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Trying to fix scale bugs/crashes in gdk_pixbuf_scale(), here
	is what I determined with gdk-pixbuf 0.9.2 (CVS, as of now):
	
	This only applies when the scale width offset is not zero _and_ the
	resulting right edge of the scaled image is also the right side of the
	source image. (in other words: when rendering a tile that is aligned
	with the right side of the image).

	Under the above conditions, gdk_pixbuf_scale() breaks for all
	GdkInterpTypes except NEAREST. gdk_pixbuf_compsite_color() is only
	broken for TILES (I suspect this is because eog uses it, but does not
	have a TILES option, so that was not tested). At this point I was tired
	of dealing with this mess, so I _think_ gdk_pixbuf_composite() is
	broken the same as gdk_pixbuf_scale() [memory is getting mushy]. Oh,
	and breakage means the last 2 columns of pixels are seamingly generated
	from some random memory point, at best causing them to be corrupted, at
	worst causing a crash.

	So what I did: Use gdk_pixbuf_composite_color() since it is the least
	broken. It does seem slower than gdk_pixbuf_scale(), since it does
	more.

	(I hope the gdk-pixbuf included with GTK+ 2.0 has this fixed, as the
	gdk-pixbuf in CVS seems to have little maintenance lately - 2 ChangeLog
	entries in 3 months...)

Fri Jan 12 12:07:44 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c, typedefs.h: Well, it now displays the image in all zoom
	settings. Still have to add (back) scrolling, set up the update call
	function, and work on redrawing the borders (borders currently do not
	get cleared to remove the previous image).

Thu Jan 11 13:35:15 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.[ch], typedefs.h: Start towards a new method of rendering the
	image to the screen. The image window is now basically _only_ a
	gtk_drawing_area, and we do all the scrolling ourselves. Currently I
	am lucky if it doesn't crash, and really lucky if part of an image
	appears :) Well, at least the namespaces for the functions are at
	least a little saner now, so I accomplished something, althought the
	whole thing still needs to be re-thought from the tile/render point
	of view.
	* dnd.c, fullscreen.c, img-main.c, img-view.c, main.c, slideshow.c,
	utildlg.c, window.c: Made it at least compile for testing.

Mon Jan  8 22:57:05 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.c (dupe_menu_view): Use filelist_change_to_full_path() in place
	of main_image_change_to(), so that the file list of the main window
	also syncs to the image.

Mon Jan  8 21:55:54 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: Added thumbnail support.

Mon Jan  8 20:22:12 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dupe.[ch]: More work, many fixes, added right click menu, and
	generally made it nice to use (useable).
	* collect-table.c: Add the collection to the dupe window.
	* menu.c: Added 'Find duplicates...' to the file menu.

Sat Dec 30 16:45:51 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	allow saving of user's accel keys (to ~/.gqview/accels).
	* menu.c: Use GtkItemFactory, fix callbacks to (void) for those that
	do not use the data (because GtkItemFactory has a weird signal
	alignment (gpointer is first).

	Sorry translators, menus must be re-translated (and it does not look
	like fun with GtkItemFactoryEntry using menu paths)

Thu Nov 30 17:45:08 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* configure.in: Do more compatible checks for png ?
	* tabcomp.c: Sanity checks for adding NULL key/path to list.

Mon Nov 20 12:32:08 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.c: Added render_types to better decrease unnecessary renders.
	* main.c, window.c: Save/Restore the window positions like in gimp,
	since that seems to work better.
	(And gimp programmers can't be wrong :)

Wed Nov  8 09:16:45 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	and made it consistent with the one for view window. Added 'slideshow
	pause'.

	GIF loader seems to error out on thumbnail _RE_generation, will have
	to look into that.

	thumbnail code.

Mon Aug 28 08:06:15 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* image.[ch]: Moved to gdk-pixbuf (no caching right now), slow and

	places though <-- FIXME.
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Added gdk-pixbuf, new files.

	positions' is enabled)
	* gqview.h, main.c: Renamed .gqviewrc to gqviewrc, since we are now
	our own hidden .gqview dir, no reason to hide the config file.

Thu Jul  6 23:00:10 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* collect-dlg.c: Don't free the data in the confirm_cancel callback,
	it is just a NOP.
	* collect-table.c, collect.c: More work on popup menus, added recursive
	directory dropping. And more work overall.

  > New feature! Thumbnails displayed in the file list(us 't' to toggle).
  > Thumbnails size can be selected (General Options).
  > Rewrite (again) of the file list (to support adding/removing entries
    without re-reading the entire directory listing, [still need to convert
    the directory list, however]).
  - minor display layout changes (to accomodate the progress bar).
  - if a file format cannot be determined, a generic 'unknown image' picture
    is displayed.
  - added display for the number of files listed.
  - added '-debug' command line option for debug output (preliminary)

0.2.1  (4-8-98)
  > Added a handle, now the file lists are sizeable.
  - renamed menu item Exit to Quit.
  - Added missing file includes that were exposed with GTK+ 0.99.10 release.

0.2.0  (3-19-98)
  > External editors can be specified in the configuration window (max 8).
      Under the "external editors" tab.
  - Popup menu for filelist (delete, rename, and edit).
  - Filelist highlight now follows currently viewed image.
  - A few minor fixes.

0.1.1  (3-3-98)
  > Updated code to compile with GTK+-0.99.4
     (will not work with previous versions of GTK)
  - Command line no longer requires a complete path to a file if it is in
    the current working directory. (or must be relative to it)
  - When moving to the next (or previous) image, the file list
    scrolls to include the current image's name.

0.1.0  (2-28-98)
  > Added menu bar.
  > Added keyboard shorcuts.

  > Command line support. (specify startup directory or file to view)
  > Can set startup directory in options window (can be disabled)
  > Added custom filtering options to support more formats
     (Imlib supports almost anything your system can read using
      ImageMagick or Netpbm, if available).
  > File operations: create directory, rename file, delete file.
  > clicking mouse on image:
      button one: next image
      button two: previous image
      button three: popup menu (zoom, file operations, edit image)
  > Added option to load image into The Gimp.
  - Fixed a bug in the history list truncating routine. (GQview would crash)
  - Other minor improvements and fixes.

0.0.3  (2-18-98)
  > Source code clean up! The source code has been organized
    and is now readable (some code still needs organizing, but
    at least now the code can be followed).
  > Makefile rewritten, it may still need editing for some systems.
    The '-g' gcc option was removed for the released code, this makes
    the binary about 1/3 smaller (it removes some debugging facilities)
  - Fixed the transparency problem. This removes the garbage displayed
    where an image is transparent, unfortunately for now it is set to purple.

0.0.2  (2-14-98)
  > Rewrote directory and file list handling, the lists
    can now be of any length.
  > Lists are now sorted.
  > History list no longer expands out of control as the
    directory path gets longer, entries are truncated at
    32 characters and '/...' is prepended.
  > Added configuration window, including:
    - show or hide dot files
    - select default zoom mode for new image
    - disable file filtering
    - choose file types to filter
    - about tab for version and contact info

0.0.1  (2-10-98)
