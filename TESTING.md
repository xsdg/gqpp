# Geeqie testing and validation patterns

Geeqie incorporates a number of forms of validation, including functional tests,
unit tests, and static analysis.  These tests are defined towards the end of the
root `meson.build` file (search the file for `test(`).

You can run all enabled suites using:

```text
meson test -C build
```

Three test suites exist: `functional`, `unit`, and `analysis`.  You can pick out
particular suites to execute with commands like:

```text
meson test -C build --suite functional
meson test -C build --suite analysis --suite unit
```

See the Unit tests section for how to enable unit tests.

## Unit tests

Unit tests live under `src/tests`.  Because they include a lot of extra code in
the Geeqie binary, they must be manually enabled with a command like:

```text
meson setup -D unit_tests=enabled build
```

After that point, they can be executed with:

```text
meson test -C build -v --suite unit
```

Or you can run them by hand by starting geeqie with the `--run-unit-tests`
argument:

```text
$ ninja -C build
...

$ ./build/src/geeqie --run-unit-tests
[==========] Running N tests from 1 test suite.
...
[==========] N tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] N tests.
```

### Adding or modifying unit tests

Geeqie uses the Googletest framework, which is well-documented: \
<http://google.github.io/googletest/>

To add a new testcase in an existing test file, just add it to the test file.
That testcase will be automatically picked up and executed.

To create a new test file, create the file under `src/tests/` with a name that
matches the file being tested.  **Then make sure to add the file to
`src/tests/meson.build` or it won't be seen or executed.**

## Functional tests

The Geeqie functional tests rely on `xvfb` in order to be able to start the app
in a standard way without requiring access to a real X server on the test
machine.  If `xvfb` is not present, these tests will not run.

### Basic test

This just ensures that Geeqie will start.  It uses the `--version` flag to keep
Geeqie from staying running.

### Image tests

The image tests are only enabled in unit_test mode.  You can set that with:

```text
meson setup -C build -D unit_test=enabled
```

This tests that Geeqie can successfully open and provide metadata info about a
library of images of different types.

See `scripts/image-test.sh` for more details.

### Lua tests

Verifies that Geeqie can successfully run lua scripts by opening a stock test
image and running a variety of lua operations on it.

See `scripts/lua-test.sh` for more details.

## Static Analysis

### Code correctness

Runs `clang-tidy` code correctness checks for every source file in the project.
Note that this will only execute when running from a clone of the Geeqie git
project.

See `.clang-tidy` and <https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html>
for more details.

### Single value enum checks

Checks for single-value enums.

See `scripts/enum-check.sh` for more details.

### Debug statement checks

Checks for `DEBUG_0`, `DEBUG_BT`, or `DEBUG_FD` statements in the source tree.

See `scripts/debug-check.sh` for more details.

### Temporary comment checks

Checks for comments starting with `//~` in the source tree.

See `scripts/temporary-comments-check.sh` for more details.

### GTK4 migration regression checks

Checks that gtk functions for which there is a Geeqie GTK4 compatibility
function have a `gq_` prefix.

See `scripts/gtk4-migration-regression-check.sh` for more details.

### Untranslated text checks

Checks for strings that haven't been marked for translation (starting with `_(`)
in the source tree.

See `scripts/untranslated-text.sh` for more details.

### Ancillary files checks

Performs validation of non-source files within the project.  This includes
linting of `appdata` files, `desktop` files, Markdown files, GTK UI builder
files, and shell scripts, as well as ensuring that all relevant build options
are covered in the functional test configuration.

These checks also require `xvfb` for the GTK UI builder validator to run.

See `scripts/test-ancillary-files.sh` for more details.
