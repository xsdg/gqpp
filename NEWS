Comparing images side-to-side

View/Connected Scroll
View/Connected Zoom

File marks

Each image can be marked with up to 6 different
flags, it is possible to convert marks to selection and vice versa,
even boolean operations are supported
Note: marks are visible in file list and fullscreen mode with info,
they are not visible in icon list (yet).

Menu: Select/Show Marks
Select/Mark ...

File grouping

It is possible to group files which have the same name and different extension,
and show them as one entry. Typical usage: raw + jpeg, raw + xmp.

Configuration: Preferences/Filtering

External commands

It is possible to replace internal copy/move/delete operations with
external commands, for example create hardlinks instead of copying files.

External editors handling was improved, it is possible to run an editor
on the best fitting file type, and the exit status is reported back
to Geeqie.

Configuration: Preferences/Editors
Menu: Edit/...


Controls redesign

Most of controls was added to menu and is handled via keyboard accelerators,
thus they can be configured in ~/.geeqie/accels

The default function of keys 1, 2, 3, ... was changed from zoom to mark toggle and
function of <ctrl>1, <ctrl>2, <ctrl>3, ... from external editor to selecting mark.

Exiv2 support

Geeqie can be optionally linked with exiv2 to improve support for image metadata.
Details are at http://geeqie.wiki.sourceforge.net/Exiv2

Various enhancements

    * Customizable overlay info (see Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Full screen).
    * Configurable frame around image (see Edit > Preferences > Image > Limit image size when autofitting).
    * Custom border color around the image (see Edit > Preferences > Image > Custom border color).
    * Honor selection while fullscreen navigation (patch by Uwe Ohse).
    * Make properties tabs reorderable through drag'n drop (patch by Laurent Monin).
    * Various exif improvements (see Edit > Preferences > Properties > Exif, based on patch by Uwe Ohse).
    * Setting no limit size to trash directory is now possible using zero as value.
    * Main configuration file was renamed from gqviewrc to geeqierc.
    * Add the possibility to match duplicates on the name but ignoring the case (see Find Duplicates dialog).
    * Add the possibility to print file names with path (see Path checkbox in the Text tab in the Print dialog).
    * Histogram added to full screen overlay (press twice I to display, J to change mode, K for channels).
    * Add support for some Samsung raw files (.pef) (need testing).
    * In the collection view, display the full path to the file as tooltip when Show filename text is on.
    * Secure rc file saving was implemented, it reduces the risk of corruption during the save.

    * Hiding the self (.) directory from directory view is now possible (Edit > Preferences > Filtering > Show dot directory)

    * Toggling Grayscale now applies to all images.
    * Add zoom ratio display to OSD in fullscreen mode. It appears as [%zoom%] in fullscreen info string.
